# Expenses

A PWA with full offline support for your expenses.
You can save it to your homescreen and use it daily to track all your :beer:  and
:coffee: expenses.

So for the layout is only suited for mobile screen (soon to be cahnged).

## Story

This project is a sort of playground which I created to learn and experiment 
with PWA development.


## Tech

### APP
The client app  started as a `create-react-app` with Typescript. The offline database is
implemented using [RxDb](https://rxdb.info/). 
I'm using [visx](https://airbnb.io/visx) for the graphs  and
[react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) for the animations.

Styling is done with juicy [Theme UI](https://https://theme-ui.com/).
